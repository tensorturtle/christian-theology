# Patristic Period (100-700)

"Era of the Church Fathers"

Christianity began in Jerusalem in the first century AD.
Christianity considered itself to be an extension and development of Judaism, and expanded in previously judaic areas.
Christianity spread quickly by the efforts of people like Paul of Tarsus.

## Centers of early theological activity

By the end of the first century, Christianity had spread across eastern Mediterranean. It was also firmly established within Rome.

As the Roman church gained power, conflicts arose between Rome and the eastern churches, which is the precursor to the division of the churches later on.

Three main centers of theology at the time:

1. Alexandria (Egypt) developed a unique form of Christian theology because of their intellectual link to Platonist philosophy.
2. Antiochia and Cappadocia (Turkey) had an early settlement of Christian churches. Paul visited them often in his missionary journeys. These regions emerged as a center of Christian theology. `Cappadocian Fathers` refers to 4th century scholars who notably developed the doctrine of the holy trinity.
3. North Africa (present day Algeria, was part of Carthage) was Rome's rival in Mediterranean power. It was a colony of Rome at the time.

## Main Disputes addressed 

+ The relationship between Christianity and Judaism: *Do non-jews have to get circumcised?* *Do Christians need to abide by Jewish customs regarding food?*
+ **Apologetics**: This was a time of strife and persecution from the state, so enlightened discussions about academic theology did not take place. Instead, passioned, personal apologetics for Christianity were more relevant, such as that given by `Justinus Martyr` to Roman emperor Antonius.

## Roman Emperor Constantine makes Christianity the state religion

It was the beginning of real doctrinal and theological discussion within the church.

## Studying the Patristic Period is difficult

for contemporary students, because:

1. It is difficult to relate to the importance or relevance of the problems that they faced.
2. Much of the discussion is based on Platonic and Neo-platonic philosophy, which are vastly different from Plato's original works.
3. The patristic period was an intellectually tumultuous time, when many of the core dogmas were being established.
4. Linguistic and political divisions created an east-west division. The Eastern Greek church were more open to applying philosophy to the scripture, whereas the western Latin church were purists and opposed mixing the scripture with anything.

## Theologians

### Justinus Martyr

100-165

Known for his apologetics. He suggested that within classical philosophy there is a `Logos Spermatikos` (the seed of logos) that serves as an intellectual precursor to Jesus Christ's divine revelation.

### Irenaeus of Lyon

130-202

As bishop of Lyon, fought heresies like Gnosticism.

### Tertullian

First to produce Latin Christian literature. Also fought Gnosticism. 

Against `Marcion of Sinope` who claimed that the old and new testaments are referring to different gods, Tertullian argued the opposite, that they are the same god. This laid the foundation for the holy trinity.

He argued for the sufficiency of the bible, and opposed establishing a theology based on sources external to the bible.

### Origen

1. Differentiated between **allegorical** and literal expressions in the bible
2. View that Jesus is a 'lesser' form of God the father is considered by some to have influenced the `Arian Heresy`.

### Cyprianus of Carthage

Advocated for `unity` as the important criteria for the Church. Looking in the direction of the one truth aligns everyone to `unity`, but heresies and evildoers disrupt and corrupt unity.

### Athanasius

Made significant contributions to the Arian controversey by arguing the disasterous consequences if Arianism were to be true.

### Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus

also collectivelly called the `Cappadocian fathers`.

Important figures in establishing the holy trinity: `Three hypostases in one ousia`  

### Augustine of Hippo

Hippo is located in today's Algeria.

Resolved many early disputes in the establishment of the western church.

+ First to define a `systematic theology` by combining the various areas of theological research. 
+ Fought [Donatistism](donatism), who rejected authority of Christian clergy who were not 'perfect'
+ Fought [Pelagianism](pelagianism), who rejected original sin
+ Contributed to doctrine of holy trinity

## Topics

### Which books belong in the New Testament Canon?

#### The rough timeframe

To the writers of the books in the New Testament, 'the bible' refers to what we now know as the Old Testament.

During this era, people like `Justinus Martyr` argued that the books in the New Testament should also be considered as canon.

At the time of `Irenaeus`, the four gospels became canon.

At the time of `Clemens of Alexandria` (around 150-215), Acts, 14 Pauline epistles, and the Book of Revelation were added to the canon.

The collective academic opinion of which books should be included within the New Testament canon converged slowly across a century,
until in 367, Athanasius identifies 27 books which are identical to what we have today.

There were significant debates about the order as well.

#### By what criteria were books canonized?

We do not know exactly.

At the time, however, there were some basic principles, like:

The church does not 'grant authority' to the books. Instead, the church 'accepts' or 'recognizes' the authority already inherent in them.

Some early Christians advocated for `apostolic authorship` as a criteria.

Anyhow, the question of canon was settled by early 5th century and was not raised until the Reformation.

### Fighting Gnosticism

Gnosticism was a complex movement that externally appeared in many respects similar to Christianity,
but with wildly unorthodox interpretations of the bible.

Irenaeus and Tertullian both argued against those wild interpretations by appealing to orthodoxy.
Orthodoxy is the tradition of proper interpretation, handed down across continuous generations,
which guides the interpretation of difficult biblical passages.

Gnostics could not claim to have the same level of historical authenticity as the early Church.

### Confirmation of Ecumenical Creeds

Ecumenical creeds refer to the `Nicene Creed`, the `Apostles Creed`, and the `Athanasian Creed`.

They are accepted universally by all Christians.

Among the reasons for creating and accepting them,
an important function that is somewhat unrelatable today is as a way of fighting off heresies.
By creating a shared declaration of specific dogmatic faiths, the early church posed a united front against heresies that were a major problem in the era.


### The Arian Controversy

Heresey | Orthodoxy
--- | ---
Arius | Athanasius of Alexandria
"Jesus Christ is a Creature, made from nothing. Christ was God's first production, and everything else is created through Jesus." | "Jesus Christ is co-eternal and con-substantial with the Father"

The `first council of Nicaea` declared Arius a heretic by formulating the `Nicene Creed` which includes the word `homoousios`, meaning 'one in essence'.

The `first council of Nicaea` was significant because it was the first gathering of leaders of various denominations. Therefore, conclusions drawn here could be universally respected across all Christian denominations.

However, real life wasn't as simple as this. When some big issue was settled, people got into more debates about the finer points of that, and so on. It never really ended.

### Donatism

Donatists claimed that only saints can be members of the church,
and anyone who isn't perfect shouldn't be allowed in.

They held this exclusive view because they felt betrayed by people who had left the church when they were being prosecuted and then came back as if nothing happened.



### Pelagianism
