# Patristic Era (100-700)

"Era of the Church Fathers"

Christianity began in Jerusalem in the first century AD.
Christianity considered itself to be an extension and development of Judaism, and expanded in previously judaic areas.
Christianity spread quickly by the efforts of people like Paul of Tarsus.

## Centers of early theological activity

By the end of the first century, Christianity had spread across eastern Mediterranean. It was also firmly established within Rome.

As the Roman church gained power, conflicts arose between Rome and the eastern churches, which is the precursor to the division of the churches later on.

Three main centers of theology at the time:

1. Alexandria (Egypt) developed a unique form of Christian theology because of their intellectual link to Platonist philosophy.
2. Antiochia and Cappadocia (Turkey) had an early settlement of Christian churches. Paul visited them often in his missionary journeys. These regions emerged as a center of Christian theology. `Cappadocian Fathers` refers to 4th century scholars who notably developed the doctrine of the holy trinity.
3. North Africa (present day Algeria, was part of Carthage) was Rome's rival in Mediterranean power. It was a colony of Rome at the time.
